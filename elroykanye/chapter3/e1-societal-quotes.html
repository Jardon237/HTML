        <p>
            &#09;&quot;Society as a whole benefits immeasureably from a climate in which all persons,
            regardless of race or gender, may have the opportunity to earn respect, responsibility,
            advancement and renumeration based on <span class="strike-through">inheritance</span> ability.&quot;
            <br><br>

            Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
        </p>
        <p class="gray-background">
            &#09;&quot;Shall I not inform you of a better act than fasting, alms and prayers? Making peace
            between one another: enmity and malice tear up heavenly rewards by the root.&quot;
            <br><br>

            Prophet Muhammad
        </p>
        <p>
            &quot;Education is the <span class="bold">powerful weapon</span> which you can use to change the world.&quot;
            <br><br>
            President Nelson Mandela
