                    The smallest electrical system in Lawrence's downtown is the electrical syste in one small shop or restaurant which 
                    typically occupies one lot and is two stories tall. One lot is 25 feet wide and 120 feet deep. Most of the downtown
                    properties are this size. However, some are taller and/or occupy two or more lots. For one of the larger properties,
                    scale up the values in the table below.

                <div class="bg-light-green">
                    To avoid rooftop HVAC clutter, maximize efficiency, and facilitate thermal storage, a ground-source heat pump heats
                    and cools water for HVAC and provides free heat for domestic hot water during the cooling season. Peak electrical
                    consumption (at 4:00 PM) is about 7.5 kW. At peak cooling load, the HVAC equipment consumes 4 kW. At noon, the 
                    HVAC cooling equipment uses 2 kW to cool spaces and 2 kW to chill water for storage and use at a later time.
                    Chilled-water storage between 9:00AM and 3:00PM stores enough cooling to provide maximum cooling for 3 
                    evening hours. With 15% capacity factor (50% clouds), solar collectors rated at 18 kW save $3300/year.
